# **How to pay and file 2020 state and federal taxes** ü¶ñ
*The deadline to file is April 15, 2021*

### **If your 2020 income was less than $72,000** here's how you should file your taxes:
**TL;DR:** Use [this lookup tool](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/filing-status) on the IRS Free File site to find a service and follow the link from the IRS site to signup. üöÄ

If your 2020 income was less than $72,000, find an IRS Free File "Partner" service that fits your situation [here](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/), sign up using a link from the IRS Free File page to the service you chose (even if you qualify for Free File, TurboTax and other providers will happily take your money if you use the wrong signup page, they are the worst üëé) and then use that 3rd party service (TurboTax, TaxSlayer, etc) to file. Double check that you can file state taxes free of charge in your state when you choose a service. The easiest way is to use the [IRS Free File Partner lookup tool](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/filing-status). Not every service is free for the same demographic, so you have to find one that matches your income, state, filing status and so on.

You could also use the [Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/free-file-fillable-forms) if you know what you're doing and have some time, but the tax code is deliberately confusing so I recommend you don't do this.

**Important Note For TurboTax Users:** 
>Most people use TurboTax. They sign up for a free account, fill out all their forms and then, unless they ONLY NEEDED TO FILE W2 INCOME, TurboTax informs them that they'll need to pay to file. If you're in this situation, and you qualify to Free File using TurboTax ([here are the requirements](https://freefile.intuit.com/)) you can switch from a "Free" (but evidently CURSED, and not always free) account to a *Free File* account (actually what it sounds like) using [this F.A.Q. as a guide](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/downgrading/help/how-do-i-switch-to-turbotax-free-file-program/00/26264). If you followed [this link](https://freefile.intuit.com/) or one from the IRS Free File site to begin with, you wouldn't have to go through this process.

### **If your 2020 income was over $72,000**, this guide isn't really intended for you. 
That said, you can either use the [Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/free-file-fillable-forms) if you're very confident and want to waste many hours of your life or you can pay a service like TurboTax or an Accountant to do it for you. 

Good luck ü§¶üêã
